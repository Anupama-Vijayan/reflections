How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    diff -u old new file -- will give you the difference in the content of the 2 files
	
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    its easier to track the versions and changes

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    con: u ve to think ,ie u dont ve the privilege to forget to commit
	pro: u dont do a lot or less than needed commits, so commit history will be ideal
	

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Maybe coz the files are inter related , and by this way all will be updated.
 commit is a  snapshot of all the files in the repository when the commit is made.
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log will give you all the commit listed along with the time and the commit ids
	git diff along with the commit ids will give you green and red colored lines to point out the addition and deletion of lines in the 2 file versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

since the change is reversible, its okay to make any changes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

  when i do projects.
